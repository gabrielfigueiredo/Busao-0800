# Busão 0800 Fonts
WORK IN PROGRESS
*/ As in: 'this is not a fully finished product, but it is most likely not receiving any updates in the near future'*

The Busão 0800 fonts are an initiative developed by Gabriel Figueiredo to contribute to the campaign for the approval of PL 60/2025, a municipal bill trying to implement free access to public transport on the city of Belo Horizonte.

The fonts are based on several lettering styles found on the LED screens of Belo Horizonte buses, and each style is available both with static .OTF fonts (with 10 separate weights per style) and a dynamic .TTF(GX) variable font file.
Rather than trying to faithfully recreate each of the several different styles found on the city buses, the fonts try to blend the most iconic styles into one cohesive system.

To contribute to the project, contact Gabriel Figueiredo at oi(at)gabrielfigueiredo.com
